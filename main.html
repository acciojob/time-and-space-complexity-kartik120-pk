    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity measures how an algorithm's runtime grows with input size. A good algorithm should have optimal time complexity and be efficient.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total memory used by an algorithm, including input storage, auxiliary variables, and recursion stack. It is often expressed as O(n), where n is the input size.</p>
