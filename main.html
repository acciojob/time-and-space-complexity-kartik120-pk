    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them faster for large inputs.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run as a function of the input size. It is typically expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), to represent how memory usage scales with input size.</p>
